      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This Confidentiality Agreement (hereinafter
        referred to as the &quot;Agreement&quot;) is made and effective the __
        day of ______, 199_ by and between ________________ (hereinafter referred

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>2. Recipient's Obligations.</strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Recipient agrees that the Confidential
          Information is to be considered confidential and proprietary to Owner
          and Recipient shall hold the same in confidence, shall not use the Confidential
          Information other than for the purposes of its business with Owner,
          and shall disclose it only to its officers, directors, or employees
          with a specific need to know. Recipient will not disclose, publish or
          otherwise reveal any of the Confidential Information received from Owner
          to any other party whatsoever except with the specific prior written
          authorization of Owner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">B. Confidential Information furnished in
          tangible form shall not be duplicated by Recipient except for purposes
          of this Agreement. Upon the request of Owner, Recipient shall return
          all Confidential Information received in written or tangible form, including
          copies, or reproductions or other media containing such Confidential
          Information, within ten (10) days of such request. At Recipient's option,
          any documents or other media developed by the Recipient containing Confidential
          Information may be destroyed by Recipient. Recipient shall provide a
          written certificate to Owner regarding destruction within ten (10) days
          thereafter.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>3. Term.</strong><br>
        The obligations of Recipient herein shall be effective [Non-Disclosure
        Period] from the date Owner last discloses any Confidential Information
        to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. Further, the obligation not to
        disclose shall not be affected by bankruptcy, receivership, assignment,
        attachment or seizure procedures, whether initiated by or against Recipient,
        nor by the rejection of any agreement between Owner and Recipient, by
        a trustee of Recipient in bankruptcy, or by the Recipient as a debtor-in-possession
        or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under local law</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>4. Other Information.</strong><br>
        Recipient shall have no obligation under this Agreement with respect to
        Confidential Information which is or becomes publicly available without
        breach of this Agreement by Recipient; is rightfully received by Recipient
        without obligations of confidentiality; or is developed by Recipient without
        breach of this Agreement; provided, however, such Confidential Information
        shall not be disclosed until thirty (30) days after written notice of
        intent to disclose is given to Owner along with the asserted grounds for
        disclosure.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>5. No License.</strong><br>
        Nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting or conferring
        any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information. It
        is understood and agreed that neither party solicits any change in the
        organization, business practice, service or products of the other party,
        and that the disclosure of Confidential Information shall not be construed
        as evidencing any intent by a party to purchase any products or services
        of the other party nor as an encouragement to expend funds in development
        or research efforts. Confidential Information may pertain to prospective
        or unannounced products. Recipient agrees not to use any Confidential
        Information as a basis upon which to develop or have a third party develop
        a competing or similar product.</font></p>

        breach by Recipient, Owner may obtain, in addition to any other legal
        remedies which may be available, such equitable relief as may be necessary
        to protect Owner against any such breach or threatened breach.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>8. Final Agreement.</strong><br>
        This Agreement terminates and supersedes all prior understandings or agreements
        on the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be modified only by a
        further writing that is duly executed by both parties.</font></p>

        Recipient may not assign this Agreement or any interest herein without
        Owner's express prior written consent.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>10. Severability.</strong><br>
        If any term of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
        to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement, including all of
        the remaining terms, will remain in full force and effect as if such invalid
        or unenforceable term had never been included.</font></p>
